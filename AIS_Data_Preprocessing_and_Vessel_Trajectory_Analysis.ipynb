Sometimes, vessels don't enter the port's exact polygon but still wait in close proximity, so adding a buffer allows for more **accurate detection** of such vessels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **buffer distance** was set as **adjustable in degrees** to allow flexibility. Given that 1 degree of latitude/longitude is roughly equivalent to 111 kilometers at the Earth's surface, this adjustment allows for easy calibration depending on the geographical region or level of granularity needed.\n",
    "- The added **buffer** ensures that vessels parked slightly outside the port’s boundary but still within a reasonable distance are also captured. This provides a more comprehensive analysis of vessel behaviors near ports.\n",

    "### **Main Technical Challenge: Data Size and Computational Complexity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling large maritime datasets posed a significant technical challenge due to the intensive **spatial computations** involved in identifying vessel trajectories and interactions near ports. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of how this challenge was addressed:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Challenges with Original Geopandas Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Computational Overhead**: Geopandas operations, such as calculating buffers and checking point-in-polygon relationships for thousands of trajectories across multiple ports, proved highly **resource-intensive**.\n",
    "    - **Time Complexity**: Each spatial operation involved iterating over vast datasets, leading to processing times of **1-2 hours** or more.\n",
    "    - **Memory Usage**: The geospatial operations consumed substantial memory, which could lead to performance bottlenecks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Optimized Solution Using Pandas**\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome these challenges, I implemented a **bounding-box filtering approach** using Pandas. This drastically reduced computational overhead while maintaining accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Steps Taken**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define a Bounding Box**:\n",
    "    - Instead of using a **spatial buffer**, I created a **bounding box** around each port’s center coordinates (latitude and longitude).\n",
    "    - The bounding box was defined by an offset of ±1 degree, corresponding to a geographical range of ~111 km (1 degree ≈ 111 km).\n",
    "2. **Filter Data Using Pandas**:\n",
    "    - Applied **simple column filtering** to include only records within the bounding box.\n",
    "    - Eliminated the need for expensive point-in-polygon checks."
